<h3 class= "center"> Short Talk- </h3>

<p id =para 1> There's a famous saying by Henry Ford- <p2 id="para2">"Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keps learning stays young".</p2> Learning is a prcocess which starts at the time of birth and goes till end. The whole life is a process of learning. The one who is not learning is not living the life. </p> 

<p>I am also a learner, a leraner from the past, a learner of the present and learning for the future. Before I should start my further talk, lets talk about my myself.</p>
